Matlab scripts and functions
============================
In this repository, I will share Matlab scripts and functions that I wrote and
that may be useful for others as well.

[**polydist**](https://github.com/Jerrythafast/matlab-scripts/blob/master/polydist.m) is
a function that calculates the Euclidean distances of points to a polynomial function.
